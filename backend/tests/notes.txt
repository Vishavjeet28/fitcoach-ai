Status: VERIFIED & PASSING (Jan 14, 2026)

The system verification script results indicate:
1. Registration Logic: ✅ PASSED (Tokens generated, User created)
2. FLE Logic: ✅ PASSED (Calorie Target 2000 confirmed)
3. Food Logging: ✅ PASSED (Schema mismatch fixed, custom foods log correctly)
4. Exercise Logging: ✅ PASSED (Calories calculated vs Provided override respected)
5. Analytics/Math: ✅ PASSED (Consumed 500 - Burned 300 = Net 200)
6. Billing Check: ✅ PASSED (Route fixed, Tier confirmed)

Backend is ready for frontend integration.

Historical Issues (Fixed):
- Registration calculated 0/null Calorie Target (Fixed in auth.controller.js)
- Food Logging Failed silently (Fixed schema mismatch in food.controller.js)
- Exercise Log Overwrote Calories (Fixed logic in exercise.controller.js)
- Billing Check Failed (Fixed route and service call in billing.controller.js)
