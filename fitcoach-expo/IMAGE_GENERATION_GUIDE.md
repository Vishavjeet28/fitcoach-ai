# Yoga Exercise Image Generation Guide

To generate consistent, high-quality step-by-step images for your yoga app that match your trainer's appearance, use the following prompt structure.

## 📸 Master Prompt Template

Copy and paste this structure into your image generator (Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Gemini). Replace the **[Bracketed Text]** with the specific step details.

> **Prompt:**
> "A high-resolution 4k professional photo of an **Asian female yoga instructor** with an athletic build, wearing a **matching light grey sports bra and grey leggings**. She is in a **bright, minimalist white yoga studio** with warm natural light and wooden floors.
>
> **Action:** [INSERT STEP DESCRIPTION HERE. Be specific about limb placement and facing direction.]
>
> **Camera/Style:** Shot on 85mm lens, realistic skin texture, sharp focus on the instructor, blurry background (bokeh), soft lighting, cinematic composition. Maintain distinct facial features consistent with previous generations."

## 🧘‍♀️ Example: Seated Chest Opener (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Starting Position
> "A high-resolution 4k professional photo of an Asian female yoga instructor in grey outfit. She is **sitting cross-legged (Sukhasana) on a yoga mat**, facing the camera. Her hands are resting gently on her knees. Her spine is tall and straight. She has a calm, focused expression. Bright minimalist studio."

### Step 2: Interlacing Fingers
> "A high-resolution 4k professional photo of an Asian female yoga instructor in grey outfit. **Side profile view.** She is sitting cross-legged and **reaching her arms behind her back to interlace her fingers**. She is engaging her shoulders. Bright minimalist studio."

### Step 3: Chest Expansion (The Peak Pose)
> "A high-resolution 4k professional photo of an Asian female yoga instructor in grey outfit. **Close-up angle from the side.** She is sitting cross-legged with hands clasped behind her back. She is **lifting her chest toward the ceiling**, arching slightly. Her head is tilted back slightly, eyes closed in relaxation. Emphasis on the opening of the chest/shoulders. Bright minimalist studio."

## 🔄 Tips for Consistency

1.  **Keep the "Subject" Description Identical:** Always use "Asian female yoga instructor in grey sports bra and leggings" (or whatever descriptions matches your trainer photo best).
2.  **Keep the Environment Identical:** Always use "Bright minimalist white yoga studio, wooden floor".
3.  **Vary the Angle:** Use keywords like "Full body shot", "Side profile", "Close-up", or "Top-down view" to make the steps easier to understand.
4.  **Reference Image:** If your tool supports it (like Midjourney `--sref` or Gemini `image_input`), upload your **Trainer Photo** along with every prompt to lock in the face/body consistency.
